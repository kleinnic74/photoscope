# Photoscope

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/kleinnic74/photoscope.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/kleinnic74/photoscope)

DIY Photo Management software written in golang, targetted at managing larger collections of photos.

Provides the back end as REST service in Golang and the front-end as an HTML application.

## Goals

* self-contained photo-indexing service capable of handling large collections (>100k images)
* no dependency on external cloud services, all running locally or self-hosted services
* able to run on NAS consumer hardware (e.g. Synology 2xx series)
* native network (REST) API to access all functions

## Roadmap

Current Phase: early prototypes

* basic photo indexing capabilities:
  * import photos
    * webdav - DONE
    * directory - DONE
  * extract time and location meta-data - DONE
  * reverse geo-code location - DONE
  * index by time - DONE
  * index by location - Needs rework, uses OSM does not work anymore
* HTML browser
    * browse index - DONE
        * thumbs not taking rotation into account
    * view photos
    * show image fullscreen in frontend - DONE

TODOS:

* read back using webdav does not work

Next Phase: more advanced indexing

* temporal event splitting (based on https://www.fxpal.com/publications/temporal-event-clustering-for-digital-photo-collections-2.pdf)
* duplicate detection

Further away:

* face recognition and indexing
* messaging service integration (e.g. Telegram auto-index bot)

## Out of scope

* photo editing
